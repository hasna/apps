[REVIEW] STATUS — @hasna/todos@0.16.0 — branch `release/todos-0.16.0`, PR #2055 (OPEN) — registry npmjs

# Current candidate (round-1, 2026-09-09)

- Package: `@hasna/todos@0.16.0` (`apps/todos/package.json` version 0.16.0).
- Release vehicle: PR #2055, `release/todos-0.16.0`, state OPEN, title
  "Release @hasna/todos 0.16.0 — shared credential resolver + three P1 fixes
  (publish blocked: gate closed)".
- PR head == `origin/release/todos-0.16.0` == `3e63609f96b054a4230f53d72e89514db71f9e03`
  (`gh pr view 2055 --json headRefOid`; `git ls-remote origin release/todos-0.16.0`).
- Worktree HEAD == `48ee38b2da9aedee5d8883eb9837cd1cf8dac729` — **9 commits ahead of the
  PR head, none pushed**. The CI-green evidence below covers 3e63609f9, not 48ee38b2d.
- Registry negative control: `npm view @hasna/todos version` → `0.15.52`;
  `npm view @hasna/todos@0.16.0 version` → E404 (unpublished). 0.16.0 is still publishable.
- Gate: CLOSED. Nothing published.

## Round-1 lens verdicts

| Lens | Verdict | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| credential-path | GO (96) | resolver chain demonstrated end-to-end; retired tiers not read; fail-closed |
| breaking-change | NO_GO (55) | remediation docs exist only in the 9 unpushed commits; at the PR head the pass-1 blocking documentation findings stand |
| test-green | NO_GO (72) | suite is green (4377 pass / 0 fail at worktree HEAD); the NO_GO is provenance — the 9 commits are unpushed and no CI run has seen them |
| release | NO_GO (30) | PR not up to date with the branch; tarball lacks `dist/release-provenance.json` until the prepublish path runs |

**Blocking remedy (not a code defect):** push `48ee38b2d` to `release/todos-0.16.0`
(updates PR #2055 — never a second PR), wait for the 5 CI checks on that exact SHA,
re-run the lenses at the pushed SHA. Until then the release vehicle (3e63609f9) and the
reviewed tree (48ee38b2d) disagree.

# Release mechanics (lane fix-infra, round 1)

## 1. Bump class of the 18 consumed `@hasna/todos` changesets

The 18 changesets deleted by `3e3c645cd` were all declared `"@hasna/todos": patch`
while several carry breaking changes (CLI `plans`/`task-lists`/`templates` → authenticated
shared API; the `@hasna/contracts` 1.0.2 client resolver; local SQLite no longer the
default). Files: `1720-todos-public-gate-delete-alignment`, `todos-api-only-lists-cli`,
`todos-api-only-plans-cli`, `todos-atomic-project-migration`,
`todos-contracts-1.0.2-client-resolver`, `todos-ledger-migration-safety`,
`todos-machine-help-authorization`, `todos-machine-migration-authority`,
`todos-plan-link-committed-receipt`, `todos-portable-sqlite-backups`,
`todos-release-capture-completion`, `todos-shared-machine-registry`,
`todos-shared-plan-workflow`, `todos-shared-project-registry`,
`todos-shared-task-coordination`, `todos-shared-task-list-workflow`,
`todos-shared-task-queries`, `todos-shared-template-cli`.

**Disposition: 0.16.0 covers the breaking class; no further bump is owed.**

- 0.16.0 is a MINOR, and for a 0.x package minor IS the breaking class — the 0.16.0
  changelog itself marks the `LocalApiConfig`/`getLocalApiConfig` removal
  "(breaking, hence minor)".
- The 18 were hand-consumed into the already-cut 0.16.0 section: `3e3c645cd` deletes them
  and edits `CHANGELOG.md` while `apps/todos/package.json` stays `0.16.0` on both sides.
  They were NOT allowed to run through `changeset version` at 0.15.52, which — declared
  `patch` — would have produced a 0.15.53 patch bump for breaking changes.
- All 18 are present in the 0.16.0 section (verified 18/18 by distinctive-phrase mapping;
  the section also carries a `### Migrating from 0.15.52` block).
- No `@hasna/todos` changeset remains pending at HEAD (`grep -l '"@hasna/todos"' .changeset/*.md` → 0).

**Rule for the next bump:** a breaking change to a 0.x member must be declared `minor`
at authoring time, never `patch`; a `patch` declaration is what the tooling would mis-bump.
No action is required for 0.16.0 because the breaking content is already in the 0.16.0
record and no unconsumed todos changeset exists.

## 2. Changesets naming packages absent from the workspace — NOT REPRODUCED

The claim that changeset files naming non-existent workspace packages break
`changeset version` repo-wide does **not** reproduce at this HEAD, at the PR head, or at
`origin/main`:

- `changeset version` in a faithful replica (root `package.json` + `.changeset` + every
  `apps/*/package.json`, run with the repo's own `@changesets/cli` 2.27.9) → **exit 0**,
  "All files have been updated. Review them and commit at your leisure".
- `./node_modules/.bin/changeset status` → **exit 0**.
- Negative control (same replica + one changeset naming `@hasna/does-not-exist`) →
  **exit 1**, `error Error: Found changeset zz-probe-dead-pkg for package
  @hasna/does-not-exist which is not in the workspace` — the probe can fire, so the
  exit-0 result is not vacuous.
- Every package named in changeset **frontmatter** is a workspace member at all three
  refs: 0 unknown across 118 files (HEAD), 136 (PR head), 147 (`origin/main`).

**Adjacent real drift (prose only, cannot break changesets):** 22 pre-existing changeset
bodies name four packages that no longer exist in the workspace —
`@hasna/paths` (20 files: `{bridge,computers,configs,connectors,conversations,dispatch,domains,economy,feedback,files,hooks,instructions-mcp-dbpath,loops,monitor,orgs,releases,repos,snapshots,telephony,workflows}-paths-resolver.md`),
`@hasna/configs` (`configs-paths-resolver.md`), `@hasna/machines`
(`1603-dispatch-drop-machines.md`), `@hasna/mementos-sdk`
(`1720-mementos-validate-fix.md`). Changesets parses frontmatter, not prose.

**Recommendation — do not delete another app's release note:**
1. Leave the 23 files in place; they are each package's release record.
2. Have each owning member rewrite the stale reference in its next changeset
   (`@hasna/paths` → the inlined resolver now shipped in that package).
3. If a machine gate is wanted, extend the existing `test/versioning` "pending changesets
   are non-empty, member-scoped" test with a frontmatter-name-resolves-to-a-workspace-member
   assertion — that check is red only on real frontmatter drift, never on prose.

## 3. `turbo.json` `tasks.test.env`

**Fixed.** `tasks.test.env` now lists all **51** `HASNA_TODOS_*` variables `apps/todos`
reads (src, scripts, `*.test.ts`; the tests spawn the built CLI/MCP/server, which inherit
exactly this set). `env: []` was filtering every one of them out of the task.

Evidence (turbo 2.5.4, the pinned version):
- Scratch workspace: `env: []` → the child prints `undefined`; `env: ["HASNA_TODOS_API_KEY"]`
  → prints the value; `env: ["HASNA_TODOS_*"]` → prints the value (wildcards are supported;
  the list is explicit so a reader sees which variables the member reads).
- Live probe against **this** `turbo.json`: with the `HASNA_TODOS_API_KEY` variable set to a
  non-secret probe string in the parent environment, `turbo run test --filter=@hasna/todos`
  printed that same string from inside the task (`@hasna/todos:test: <probe string>`) —
  the variable reaches the task.
- `turbo run test --filter=@hasna/todos --dry=json` → `envMode: strict`,
  `@hasna/todos#test` specified env = the 51 variables.
- `turbo.json` regenerated-list command is recorded in the file's `//` note.

**Residual (outside this finding's scope, recommend a follow-up):** the same strict-mode
filtering applies to the ~247 distinct non-`HASNA_TODOS_` `TODOS_*` variables the package
reads (`TODOS_DB_PATH` alone has 403 references). If the owner wants full local/CI parity,
extend the same `env` list (or add `"TODOS_*"`) — not changed here because the finding
scopes the fix to `HASNA_TODOS_*`.

## 4. This artifact's prior verdict

The previous content of this file was a NO_GO for `@hasna/todos@0.15.44` @
`f780567980d7cdba7eb79356c2f7b735de8adbab`. That verdict is **historical and superseded**
by the 0.16.0 candidate above; it is NOT a blocker for 0.16.0. Disposition of its three P1s
at the candidate (verify-p1, pass 1): all three fixed with passing regression tests —
`postgres-adapter.ts` compares instants via `changedSinceStampNewer` /
`todos_try_timestamptz(...)::timestamptz`, `cloud-router.ts` routes through the same helper,
and `task-subtree-transfer/postgres.ts` clears `schemaReady` in the catch. Caveat carried
forward: the two Postgres paths are exercised by a unit suite, not against a live Postgres
(every `*.pg.test.ts` is skipped without one — 168 skips in CI and locally alike). Original
text retained below verbatim for provenance.

## Gates re-run this round (exact output)

- `bun run test:versioning` → `22 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail`, 655 expect() calls,
  `Ran 23 tests across 5 files. [2.25s]`, exit 0.
- `bun run test:standard` → `152 pass / 0 fail`, 634 expect() calls,
  `Ran 152 tests across 22 files. [91.63s]`, exit 0 (includes `turbo-graph`, which parses
  the edited `turbo.json` and requires an acyclic build graph).
- `bun run check:names` → exit 0, `name conformance: 44 member packages, 0 violations, 0 ghost directories`.
- `bun run check:manifests` → exit 0, `33/44 publishable members conform (11 recorded exceptions); 0 refusal(s)`.
- `bun run check:frozen-locks` → exit 0, `root bun.lock and app bun.lock files match their manifests`.
- `bun run check:deploy-lanes` → exit 0, `PASS — 5 root deploy workflow(s) checked, no undiscoverable deploy lanes`;
  `todos-deploy: PASS — ci-gated trigger, gated source pin, target-pinned, scan-gated, digest-pinned, rollback-ready`.
- `changeset status` → exit 0; `changeset version` (replica) → exit 0; negative control → exit 1
  with the `not in the workspace` error (see §2).
- `bun run check:publish-guard` → long-running per-member `npm pack --dry-run` over 44
  members; it exceeded the first 300 s window. Result appended when the full run completes.
- NOT re-run here (not affected by this lane's files, owned by other lenses): the
  `apps/todos` `bun test` suite (test-green), tarball/pack/provenance gates (release),
  hosted live-path behaviour (credential-path).

# Historical — [REVIEW] NO_GO — @hasna/todos@0.15.44 @ f780567980d7cdba7eb79356c2f7b735de8adbab — registry npmjs

- P1 — `apps/todos/src/storage/postgres-adapter.ts:2847`: the Postgres sync adapter still compares `updated_at` as raw text. A newer space-form timestamp such as `2026-08-20 23:00:00` is lexically less than ISO cursor `2026-08-20T21:00:00Z`, so changed tasks are silently omitted; unparseable timestamps are also dropped.

- P1 — `apps/todos/src/cli/cloud-router.ts:3410`: the cloud changed-since/report path has the same raw lexical comparison. Cloud tasks with space-form timestamps newer than an ISO cursor are silently excluded from CLI summaries and activity reports.

- P1 — `apps/todos/src/task-subtree-transfer/postgres.ts:90-94`: `schemaReady` caches a rejected schema-sync promise without clearing it. A transient Postgres DDL/lock-timeout during `inspect`, `apply`, `readExact`, or `rollback` poisons that backend, causing every later operation to fail immediately until process restart.
