/**
 * The shared Claude session registry (owner directive 2026-08-08).
 *
 * Claude Code discovers cross-session peers ONLY through
 * `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/sessions/<pid>.json`; the message transport underneath
 * (`/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock`, 0600, same uid) is already machine-wide. With
 * per-profile `sessions/` directories, sessions running under different
 * account profiles cannot see each other even though they could talk —
 * measured on station01: copying one profile's `<pid>.json` into another
 * profile's `sessions/` made ListAgents show the peer and a native
 * SendMessage delivered cross-profile, and the exact `<pid>.json` filename is
 * required (a renamed copy is silently ignored).
 *
 * So this module makes every Claude profile's `sessions/` directory a SYMLINK
 * to one machine-level directory (`sharedClaudeSessionsDir()`), following the
 * same shape as the 0.2.38 single-inode credential broker: one real home,
 * per-profile pointers, an idempotent migration, and a doctor drift check
 * (the Claude binary owns `sessions/` and an update may recreate it as a real
 * directory, silently unsharing the machine).
 *
 * Why this is safe:
 * - Entries are pid-keyed, so concurrent writers can never collide at any N.
 * - Claude's stale-entry reaping is by pid-liveness, which is machine-scoped,
 *   so one profile's binary reaping another profile's dead entry is correct.
 * - Migration moves entries by rename(2) and then swaps the directory for a
 *   symlink, so a live session's registry path keeps resolving throughout —
 *   its next heartbeat simply lands in the shared directory.
 * - No credential or auth artifact is read or written here. Authentication
 *   stays the ONLY per-profile artifact (owner directive 2026-08-06); the one
 *   path this module touches is `<configDir>/sessions`.
 *
 * What deliberately did NOT change: per-dir liveness semantics. Guards that
 * ask "which live sessions are bound to THIS config dir" (switch guards, auth
 * heal, occupancy) go through `listDirLiveSessions`, which attributes shared
 * entries back to their owning config dir — see `claude-layout.ts`.
 *
 * MACHINE BOUNDARY: the shared directory must never leave the machine — pids
 * and `/tmp` socket paths are meaningless off-box. See
 * `sharedClaudeSessionsDir()` in `storage.ts`.
 */

/**
 * Whether the machine-shared Claude session registry is meaningful on the
 * given platform.
 *
 * Cross-session discovery over the shared `sessions/` dir is native Claude
 * behaviour on any OS, but ATTRIBUTING a shared entry back to the config dir
 * that owns it (`claude-layout.ts`, `attributeSharedEntry`) reads
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ`, which exists only on Linux (`readProcEnvironConfigDir`
 * already returns `undefined` off Linux for exactly this reason). Off Linux
 * every live session in the shared dir would count as `unknown` against
 * every profile at once, so `healSwitchedProfileDir`, the wrong-dir switch
 * guard, and the multi-session `--yes` gate would all see every profile as
 * busy whenever anything runs anywhere on the machine.
 *
 * So linking is Linux-only: off Linux a profile keeps (or is left with) a
 * normal per-profile `sessions/` directory, exactly as it behaved before this
 * feature shipped. A Linux-side darwin/win32 attribution reader is tracked
 * separately (task 758b62a6) rather than attempted here.
