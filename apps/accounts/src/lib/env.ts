/**
 * Authority over the accounts REGISTRY itself. `accounts` is the trusted wrapper and
 * legitimately holds these in order to resolve a profile name to a config dir; the
 * tool binary it launches is a coding agent running against an arbitrary,
 * potentially prompt-injectable repository, and it needs the config dir and nothing
 * else. So these stop at the spawn boundary.
 *
 * ENUMERATED, NOT PREFIX-MATCHED, and that is the whole point. A
 * `startsWith("HASNA_ACCOUNTS")` scan reads as equivalent and is not: this package
 * accepts unprefixed and differently-prefixed aliases for the same authority, and a
 * prefix scan leaks every one of them. Each entry below cites the consumer that
 * reads it, so the list can be re-derived rather than trusted:
 *
 *   HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_KEY, ACCOUNTS_API_KEY
 *     -> lib/cloud-accounts.ts deriveEnv(). Bearer credential for the registry /v1
 *        API, and it is NOT read-only: list/create/update/rename/delete any profile
 *        fleet-wide. ACCOUNTS_API_KEY is a full alias and has no HASNA_ prefix.
 *   HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_URL, ACCOUNTS_API_URL
 *     -> lib/cloud-accounts.ts deriveEnv(). Not itself secret; denied so the child
 *        cannot address the registry at all.
 *   HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_SIGNING_KEY, HASNA_API_SIGNING_KEY
 *     -> server/config.ts resolveSigningSecret(). The HMAC secret that MINTS api
 *        keys — strictly more powerful than the bearer token above. Note the
 *        fallback's prefix is HASNA_, not HASNA_ACCOUNTS_.
 *   HASNA_ACCOUNTS_DATABASE_URL, ACCOUNTS_DATABASE_URL
 *     -> NOT hand-listed. Taken from serverDataBackendEnvKeys("accounts").databaseUrlKeys in
 *        src/generated/storage-kit/backend.ts, which is the same spec
 *        resolveDatabaseUrl()/createServerPoolFromEnv() consult for server/app.ts
 *        and server/migrate.ts. A direct DSN carries its own password and is
 *        unscoped SQL access to the whole registry — strictly worse than the
 *        bearer token, which is at least bound to the /v1 API's own authz.
 *
 *        DERIVED RATHER THAN COPIED because copying it is what went wrong: the
 *        first version of this list hand-wrote only the HASNA_-prefixed form and
 *        silently leaked the bare `ACCOUNTS_DATABASE_URL` alias, which the kit
 *        generates as `${token}_DATABASE_URL` and reads with equal authority.
 *        That is the very failure this comment warns about, committed inside the
 *        fix for it. Deriving from the resolver's own spec means the deny list
 *        cannot drift from what the resolver accepts.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT DENIED: the retired storage-MODE keys. A launched session
 * that inherits a stale `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_STORAGE_MODE` (or alias) has it
 * SCRUBBED with an advisory warning by `scrubLegacyStorageMode` at transport
 * resolution — the package's own legacy fleet drop-in
 * (`~/.config/environment.d/accounts-cloud.conf`) still exports it, so a hard
 * throw would crash every CLI invocation on machines carrying the drop-in.
 * Scrubbing keeps the stale value out of every resolver (no split-brain) and
 * out of the child environment without ever routing on it. The usage-hook's
 * local-only path (`resolveLocalStore`) deliberately does not consult the
 * resolver, so it never warns on a stale variable (f70e8357).
 * Also not denied: PATH, proxy, TLS, Bedrock/Vertex and cloud-SDK environment,
 * which this module's existing policy keeps inside the caller's trust binding.
