# Changelog

All notable changes to `@hasna/accounts` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.42] - 2026-08-09

`npm/accounts/v0.2.41` is immutable and remains unpublished at its old
human-review-bound candidate. This forward release carries the 0.2.41 product
changes without moving or recreating that tag.

### Fixed

- **The npm release gate now requires one cryptographically authenticated
  independent coding-agent review instead of a human environment approval
  (OPE-00210).** The `npm-release` environment retains its environment-scoped
  secrets and exact custom tag-only deployment policy, but must have zero
  required reviewers. An immutable annotated tag names the publishing agent
  and an exact GitHub commit-comment receipt. The workflow verifies that
  receipt under the Rawls Ed25519 public key pinned in a versioned trust
  document and requires exact agreement on repository, commit, package/version,
  tag, workflow blob, trust-document blob, registry, publisher, reviewer, `GO`,
  and zero open reachable in-scope P0/P1 blockers. A reviewer-only signer builds
  and posts that canonical receipt without exposing its vault-held private key;
  later key changes require an old-key signature anchored to immutable prior
  published package bytes. Missing, stale, mismatched, edited, self-reviewed,
  `NO_GO`, unauthorized rotations, or blocking receipts fail before packing or
  publication.

## [0.2.41] - 2026-08-09

Release span measured from the previous release tag to the head being published
(`npm/accounts/v0.2.40` = `5bd2a69c` .. `6b9b3859`): six commits, four of them
behaviour changes. `6418605` (#143) and `d3270bf` (#145) are docs-only release
records.

### Added

- **The machine-shared Claude session registry: native cross-session messaging
  works across ALL account profiles.** Claude Code discovers cross-session
  peers (ListAgents/SendMessage) only through
  `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/sessions/<pid>.json`, while the socket transport
  underneath is already machine-wide — so sessions in different profiles could
  talk but could not see each other. Every Claude profile's `sessions/` is now
  a symlink to one machine-level registry
  (`~/.hasna/accounts/shared/claude-sessions/`), following the 0.2.38
  single-inode broker shape: one real home, per-profile pointers, an
  idempotent migration, a doctor drift check. New profiles are born linked;
  launch/switch/env self-heal the link; `accounts migrate-sessions
  [--dir|--all]` converts existing dirs (rename-based, safe with live
  sessions, dedupes duplicated `<pid>.json` bridges by newest copy); `accounts
  doctor` flags a link a Claude update replaced with a real dir and `doctor
  --apply` repairs it. Per-dir liveness semantics are preserved:
  `listDirLiveSessions` attributes shared entries back to their owning config
  dir (via `/proc/<pid>/environ`, then transcript presence, erring toward
  inclusion when unattributable), so switch guards, auth heal, and occupancy
  counts do not see the machine-wide union. Auth stays strictly per-profile:
  the one path touched is `<configDir>/sessions`, and the registry — pids and
  `/tmp` socket paths — is machine-local and must never be synced off-box.

### Fixed

- **Accounts-managed identity exports are rematerialized before configs
  prelaunch (#147).** A missing generated export is now distinguished from an
  operator-owned missing path and regenerated from the canonical,
  store-independent identities contract before launch. Managed ownership
  survives profile renames, `accounts doctor` reports both missing conditions
  truthfully, and symlink redirection of the generated export write is refused.
  The supported child command is normalized to
  `instructions export <exportPath> --canonical`.
- **The destructive fixture purge is snapshot-or-refuse (#135).** Migration
  `0005a` archives matching `accounts`, cascade-reached `current_selections`,
  and `custom_tools` rows before migration `0006` can delete them.
  `accounts-migrate --dry-run` enforces the live row-count envelope before the
  purge, and `--restore-purge-archive` restores the preserved rows in the order
  required by the existing triggers and later schema. This release does not
  claim the production migration freeze is lifted; that requires the migration
  to run against the preserved original.
- **Release verification waits for npm's install path to see the candidate
  (#144).** The verifier polls the abbreviated packument that npm resolves
  before invoking the consumer install, and gives each install/signature check
  an isolated npm cache. A retry therefore observes current registry state
  instead of replaying a pre-publication cached `ETARGET`/404.

## [0.2.40] - 2026-08-08

Release span measured from the previous release tag to the head being published
(`npm/accounts/v0.2.39` = `3becd9e9` .. `a955485e`): two commits, one of them a
behaviour change. `2e30fd6` (#140) is docs-only and recorded the 0.2.39 workflow
release.

**This release also carries everything 0.2.39 carried.** 0.2.39 published to the
registry and was never promoted, so `latest` stayed at 0.2.38 and #134, #136,
#137 and #138 reached no install. Their entries are under `[0.2.39]` below and
are not repeated here.

### Fixed

- **An interrupted release resumes instead of burning the version (#141).** A
  publish consumes the version number irreversibly, and `ensureUnpublished` was
  a bare `check(response.status === 404)` with no idempotent branch — so a run
  that published and then failed a later gate could not be re-run at all: the
  preflight refused at the first step and every subsequent step was skipped.
  Measured on release run `31225016753`, which published the 0.2.39 tarball at
  `22:51:48.830Z` and then failed step 17 (`verify-registry --phase staged`) on
  an npm attestations-endpoint `E404`; attempt 2 of the same run failed at step
  14 with `@hasna/accounts@0.2.39 already exists; versions are immutable` and
  steps 15-20 skipped. The version was burned for a fault that had nothing to do
  with the artefact.

  `resolvePublicationState()` is now shared by `ensure-unpublished` and
  `publish-staged`, and `publish-staged` re-resolves immediately before it
  mutates rather than trusting the earlier step — matching how promotion re-reads
  its snapshot before acting. `"resumable"` is returned only when the published
  version is provably the artefact in hand and nothing has been promoted from it,
  and the proof trusts no registry-reported field: `verifyDownloadedTarball`
  re-downloads the tarball and hashes those bytes locally (sha1 and sha512)
  against the integrity of the artefact just re-hashed on disk. Registry metadata
  and dist-tags are checked too, but byte identity carries the decision.

  The immutability guarantee is unchanged. A version occupied by anything other
  than this exact artefact still refuses, and now names which conjunct failed.
  Promotion gating is untouched: `verifyDistTags(_, _, "staged")` refuses to
  resume once the intended tag already points at this version.

  **Deliberately not shipped alongside it: a wider retry budget for the
  attestation read.** The endpoint lag is bounded only as `>24s` and `<4m05s`
  from a single observation, and `parseRetryOptions` caps the expressible budget
  at 6 attempts x 10s = 50s, so raising the defaults is not provably sufficient
  and must not be reported as a fix on that basis. Making the lost race
  recoverable fixes the expensive half regardless of what the lag turns out to
  be. Tracked as todos `3fdfd3f6`.

## [0.2.39] - 2026-08-08

Release span measured from the previous release tag to the head being published
(`npm/accounts/v0.2.38` = `ba3c2aae` .. `db782050`), not from the last merged PR:
five commits, four of them behaviour changes. `e56c311` (#127) is docs-only and
recorded 0.2.33's break-glass row.

### Fixed

- **`verify-registry` no longer rejects every attested release after the tarball
  is already published (#137).** npm publishes its two attestations against
  DIFFERENT in-toto statement versions — the publish attestation as
  `https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1`, the SLSA provenance as
  `https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1`. The check demanded v1 of both, which is
  unsatisfiable by construction, so release run `31185413057` published the
  0.2.38 tarball and then failed at step 17 (`verify-registry --phase staged`)
  with `in-toto statement type must be exactly https://in-toto.io/Statement/v1`,
  leaving `latest` unpromoted and requiring a manual repair. Each predicate is
  now bound to the one statement version it is allowed to carry. That is
  strictly tighter than the check it replaces in the dimension that matters: an
  unrecognised predicate type now fails closed instead of being admitted, and a
  provenance statement downgraded to v0.1 is still rejected.
- **A launch into an instruction home carrying no rules is refused (#134).** The
  existing `--allow-empty-instructions` protection guards a RENDER from
  overwriting a full home with an empty one; it did not guard a LAUNCH into a
  home that was already empty, and the empty-source branch wrote a loud warning
  and launched regardless. The guard now sits at the launch boundary —
  `cli.ts` launch/run/switch-account `--launch`, supervisor `startChild`, and
  claude-sessions resume, the last of which never called the render prelaunch at
  all. `--allow-empty-instructions` remains available on every guarded path and
  non-configs tools are exempt.
- **Two bypasses of that guard are closed (#136).** `accounts login` spawned the
  tool binary without asserting a governed home; it now asserts and accepts
  `--allow-empty-instructions`. And the governance predicate no longer counts
  any top-level `.md` file or the mere existence of a render manifest as
  evidence of rules — it recognises the specific index filename emitted for each
  configs-session tool, and requires the manifest to be drift-free with a
  non-zero source count.
- **Simultaneous usage-based auto-switches are spread instead of stacking on one
  account (#138).** Measured from the append-only usage-hook log: 69 switches
  across 17 config dirs in 42 hours, in seven clusters, the largest putting 12
  dirs onto one account in 25.2 seconds. This is a SORT KEY, not a filter — a
  shared account-keyed cooldown is forbidden by the #87 directive that a profile
  stay resumable in any session even when in use elsewhere. Demotion applies only
  among candidates that have already cleared both headroom gates, so the last
  healthy account is still returned however many dirs just claimed it.

## [0.2.38] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **Usage-based auto-switch now RUNS and DECIDES in a launched, registry-stripped
  session, and its candidate/allowlist set is what is actually on the box (tasks
  f70e8357, d3845278).** `accounts launch` strips `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_URL` /
  `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_KEY` from the launched session (registry-authority denial,
  #126) while leaving a `cloud` storage mode set, so `resolveStore()` inside the
  `usage-hook` command threw and the hook failed open into "usage-based
  auto-switching is NOT running for this session — cloud storage mode requires
  HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_URL and HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_KEY". The hook only ever touches
  local-machine state (a warmer-fed usage cache, a uuid→dir map, the credential
  symlink a switch repoints), so it now resolves a local-only store
  (`resolveLocalStore` → `HookLocalStore`, zero registry authority) and its
  broker convergence pass is handed that same local profile list, so no hook path
  consults the cloud resolver. `HookLocalStore` sources profiles from the UNION of
  the on-disk profile directories (`enumerateProfileDirs`) and the local registry
  rows — in cloud mode the on-box `accounts.json` is a fraction of the machine (7
  claude rows against 41 managed dirs on station01), and the hook's profile list
  is both the switch-candidate set and `switchAccount`'s registered-dir
  anti-exfiltration allowlist, so a session launched on an unregistered managed
  dir would otherwise have its own config dir refused as "external". Security is
  preserved: the enumerated dirs live under the credential store's own roots, as
  trustworthy as `accounts.json`, and a caller-chosen path outside those roots is
  still refused. This does not reopen #126.
- **The warmer's `--refresh` now measures a logged-in `needs-refresh` account
  instead of leaving it a readiness proxy (task d3845278).** An account whose
  access token aged out but whose refresh token is intact was reported without
  being queried, even under `--refresh`. `collectAccountsUsage` now mints a fresh
  access token first via `ensureFreshIdentityCredential`
  (`grant_type=refresh_token`, once, under the account's identity lock, converging
  the single-inode model before it writes — no second credential copy), rebuilds
  the identity, and then queries. The cache-only path is unchanged and never mints
  a token.

## [0.2.37] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **The usage-hook now self-heals a session dir that Claude re-materialized off
  the single-inode model, and `adoptForkToCentral` never adopts an older fork
  over a newer central (task 46679f8b defect C; fork-ranking follow-up
  8686e6e8).** A freshly launched Claude session COPIES its symlinked
  `.credentials.json` into a regular file at startup (materializes it), so the
  dir stops being a symlink and Claude's later in-session token refreshes land
  in that regular file while the account's central credential goes stale — the
  first switch on a fresh session then falls back to the copy path. The
  `UserPromptSubmit` usage-hook now, right after per-session convergence (so it
  reuses convergence's registered-dir security gate and runs under the same
  account identity lock), re-adopts the dir's fork onto central and re-symlinks
  the dir to central whenever the dir's `.credentials.json` is a regular file
  for an account that already has a central store. The heal is idempotent
  (already-linked → no-op), fail-open (a heal failure never blocks the prompt),
  atomic (inode moves by `rename`, atomic symlink swap, zero credential bytes
  copied), and deliberately narrow (a regular file with no central, a missing
  file, or a foreign symlink is left untouched). Separately, `adoptForkToCentral`
  now ranks the dir's fork against the central with the canonical
  `betterCredential` ordering (refresh-token presence, then usability, then
  mtime, then expiry) instead of a refresh-presence-only check: a strictly older
  materialized fork that another session has since superseded no longer clobbers
  the fresher central, husk protection is preserved, and a same-instant tie still
  keeps the session's live in-place token. New `selfHealDirLink` primitive with
  full coverage: de-migrated symlink→regular re-links with the freshest token on
  central; a stale fork is preserved in quarantine while the newer central is
  kept and linked; idempotent, no-central, missing, and foreign-link cases are
  no-ops.

## [0.2.36] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **The single-inode broker now engages for real seats, and re-adopts a Claude
  refresh fork without an env flag (task 0c5cca34, follows #129).** The shipped
  0.2.35 gate ran the husk-free broker only when the session dir was already a
  symlink or `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_SYMLINK_BROKER=1` was set. That env var is unset on
  every production box and real seat config dirs are regular files, so the
  broker was dormant for every real seat — a switch still took the legacy copy
  path (defect 1). Worse, Claude Code 2.1.223 refreshes its OAuth token by
  `rename`-ing over `.credentials.json`, which replaces a migrated dir's symlink
  with a regular file (a "fork"); a subsequent plain switch on that fork then
  reverted to the legacy copy path and reintroduced a husk (defect 2, the E1
  regression). Switching now engages the broker whenever the **incoming account
  has a central credential of record** — which `ensureProfileAuthSnapshot`
  already writes on login and on every legacy switch — so the broker activates
  for real seats with no env var, re-adopts a post-refresh fork onto its central
  and repoints, and degrades gracefully to the legacy copy path only when the
  incoming account has no central yet. `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_SYMLINK_BROKER=1` remains
  as an explicit force. Regression coverage: broker engages with the flag off
  when the target has a central; a Claude fork of a migrated dir re-adopts and
  stays a symlink with the flag off; and a target with no central still falls
  through to the legacy copy path. Seat dirs still convert at their respawn
  window via `accounts migrate-links`; this change makes that migration stick
  across Claude's in-session refresh forks.

## [0.2.35] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- **Account switching rebuilt as an atomic symlink repoint over a single
  central credential inode (task 46679f8b, PR #129).** Each OAuth account keeps
  exactly one real credential file, keyed by account uuid, under the central
  `auth/<uuid>/` store. A session points at its current account through a
  symlink (`.credentials.json` -> that central file), and a switch atomically
  repoints the symlink via a rename swap — no credential bytes are copied, no
  logout occurs, and no husk is left behind. This removes the multi-copy fan-out
  that was the husking root cause and lets two sessions safely share one central
  inode, relying on Claude's on-disk mtime-watch + refresh-save CAS for
  concurrent refresh on that single file. Adds `symlink-broker` with a
  link-migration path and full regression coverage.

## [0.2.34] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`accounts apply` never deletes the live credentials file (bug 04a350a9,
  task d132234c).** `restoreClaudeAuthFromProfile` answered "nothing
  restorable" by `unlink`-ing the live `~/.claude/.credentials.json`,
  destroying a live login that owner detection had just failed to park. It now
  resolves the credential before mutating anything and refuses up front when a
  profile has no restorable credential of its own, leaving the live identity
  and credential exactly as they were. `bestRestorableCredentialPath` now also
  counts the dir's own live file — unless the dir carries a foreign account —
  matching what `assertRestorableProfileAuth` already accepted.

- **A switch with no resolvable dir owner parks the outgoing credential
  instead of overwriting it (bug 04a350a9, task 61148ec0).** When
  `detectDirOwner` returns undefined (no account, no owning profile, or several
  profiles share the email), `switchAccount` used to warn and then overwrite —
  destroying a rotated-in refresh token that existed nowhere else. It now copies
  the outgoing live credential into a timestamped `orphan-snapshots/` directory
  under the accounts home before the restore; if parking throws, the switch
  aborts before the marker write and the restore. `snapshotLiveAuthToProfile`
  gained a downgrade guard so a husked (blank-token) live default can no longer
  overwrite a good parked snapshot.

- **A fallthrough switch onto the live default config dir is refused while
  profile-dir sessions are live (bug 04a350a9, task c48e92b7).** A
  `switch-account` typed at a plain tmux pane carries no `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so
  dir resolution fell through to `~/.claude` and silently rewrote it while the
  profile-dir sessions the operator was looking at never read that dir.
  `resolveSessionConfigDirWithSource` now reports which rung chose the dir; when
  the fallthrough lands on the live default and other registered profile dirs
  have live sessions, the switch names the targeted dir and refuses unless
  `--live-default` is passed. An explicit `--dir` or a set env var is a
  deliberate target and is never guarded.

- **The live default's freshest account file wins identity attribution (bug
  04a350a9, task 9b006e93).** The live default keeps its account record in both
  the inner `~/.claude/.claude.json` and the home `~/.claude.json`;
  `profileAccountJsonPaths` listed the inner file first, so a stale inner uuid
  shadowed a fresh home one and the credential broker attributed and harvested
  the live default under the wrong account. The two default-dir paths are now
  ordered freshest-first by mtime (ties keep the historical inner-first order);
  writers are unaffected because `mergeOAuthInto` writes every listed path.

## [0.2.33] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **The converge allowlist is the UNION of the active and local registries
  (todos `2865f9f5`, follow-up to #123).** #123 re-pointed
  `convergeDirCredential`'s allowlist from the local file to the active
  registry, which fixed the cloud-only dirs and regressed the local-only ones
  — the two registries are not nested. Re-measured on station01 at merge
  `931feae9`, unfiltered by tool because the read is unfiltered: active 60
  rows / 56 dirs, local 22, intersection 21, and one LOCAL-ONLY dir
  (`account022`, populated) that the pre-#123 code accepted and #123 refuses.
  The allowlist is now the union, so neither population regresses. A failing
  ACTIVE read still rejects; a failing LOCAL read is swallowed, because losing
  that half only narrows the gate.

- **The hook's detached `--ensure-fresh` token exchange is OFF by default**
  (`ACCOUNTS_HOOK_ENSURE_FRESH=1` re-enables). The spawn predates this bug and
  sits inside `if (converged)`, so the refusal was accidentally suppressing it
  for every cloud-only dir; fixing the allowlist made a network token refresh
  reachable for ~24 more dirs as an invisible side effect. That collides with
  the removal of the same operation from the 10-minute credential-broker cron
  on 2026-08-03 (active-harm mitigation against credential husks), so the
  default is the one that changes nothing while that mitigation stands. Both
  branches log. Convergence itself is file I/O and still runs every prompt.

- **The registry allowlist read's timeout is raised from 2s to 8s.** 2s sat
  BELOW the floor of the call it bounds: measured on station01 at load 16.16,
  an isolated single `GET /accounts` ran min 2.82s / median ~4.65s / max
  10.12s across 13 samples — 13 of 13 over 2s. The read therefore timed out,
  the allowlist rejected, and convergence was skipped every prompt: this bug's
  own harm by a new route. It also defeated the union, because the active half
  is read first and its rejection short-circuits before the local half merges,
  so one under-set constant disabled both remediations. 8s is chosen at the
  low end of the measured-safe range: it clears the median by ~1.7x, and the
  rest of the hook (start, converge, full usage path) measured 306-635ms over
  5 runs, so ~6.4s of the 15s deadline stays spare for a usage pass that
  actually performs a switch. Retries remain disabled, so 8s is the ceiling
  for the whole read.

- **The launch path's convergence-failure notice is redacted** before it
  reaches stderr. Defence in depth on a new output surface on the
  credential-bearing launch path; no reachable message on that path was found
  to carry a credential value.


### Fixed

- **`convergeDirCredential` resolves its security allowlist from the ACTIVE
  registry (`resolveStore()`), not the local file (todos `2865f9f5`).**
  Measured on station01 2026-08-03/04: the usage-hook's per-session
  convergence was refused on EVERY cloud-only profile dir — 1,175 refusals in
  one log file, 292 in the next — because the guard's allowlist came from
  `listProfiles()` (the local `accounts.json`, 7 claude profiles) while
  `accounts list`/`launch`/`credential-sync` resolve the cloud registry (31).
  The hook swallowed each refusal into a log line and the session proceeded
  with NO convergence, which is the husk-recurrence window: a dir that never
  adopts a sibling's rotation is a dir whose next refresh blanks it.
  `convergeDirCredential` is now async and, when no `profiles` are passed,
  reads the same registry the rest of the CLI uses. A genuinely unregistered
  dir is still refused (the exfiltration gate is unchanged and covered by a
  test on both sides of this change), and a failing registry read rejects
  rather than silently falling back to the local file.

- **A refused or failed per-session convergence is no longer silent.** The
  usage-hook now carries the failure onto its own stdout payload as a
  throttled `systemMessage` (same notice state as the other degraded
  notices), and the launch path's previously EMPTY catch in `profileEnv`
  records the failure on stderr before launching on the dir's current
  credential. Fail-open behavior is unchanged on both paths.

### Changed

- **`profileEnv` (package root export) is now async** — it awaits the
  dir-level credential convergence it already performed, whose allowlist
  resolution can now reach the hosted registry. TypeScript consumers get a
  compile-time signal; the returned env is unchanged.

## [0.2.32] - 2026-08-02

Ships the instruction-preservation fixes from tasks `29b09fa1` and `328064bc`
as one release. In addition to refusing reductions against a readable manifest,
the prelaunch guard now fails closed when the manifest is missing and the audit
is truncated, internally inconsistent, or older than the rendered instruction
files that remain on disk. A genuinely fresh home with no manifest, no audit,
and no rendered instruction files remains permitted.

### Fixed

- **A prelaunch render can no longer REDUCE a home's instruction sources
  (todos `c461ce8a`).** Measured on station01 2026-08-01: 25 of 30 claude
  profile homes held a canonical 19-source render alongside a 12-source
  identity export. `accounts launch` renders from the export, and
  `configs session apply` then deletes the seven unmatched managed files as
  `stale managed file removed` — so a single launch silently stripped seven
  doctrine rules from a governed home, at rc=0, recorded as `result: applied`.
  `account028` had already fired; the other 24 were one launch away.

  The render is now refused **before it runs** whenever the identity exports
  declare a strict subset of what the home's existing manifest already carries.
  The home is kept, the dropped ids are named on stderr and in the audit, the
  run records `result: skipped`, and **the launch still proceeds** — the
  disposition already used one branch up for the no-sources case. Failing closed
  *after* the render, which is where the previous guard sat, buys the corruption
  and a dead launch together.

  The floor comes from the home's own prior manifest, so it is independent of
  the export being validated and needs no configured rule list. `accounts` still
  does not encode the canonical set. The shortfall guard gains a third state,
  `incumbent`, distinct from `armed` and `unarmed`, so a surface can tell
  "checked against the home's own floor" from "could not check".

  Deliberate retirements go through the new `--allow-instruction-reduction`
  (`allowSourceReduction`), which skips the floor entirely.

  The refusal records `droppedSourceIds` / `droppedSourceCount` as structured
  fields on the audit. The prose `reason` is capped at `MAX_REASON_LENGTH`
  (220): measured on the real station01 fixture, an eight-id refusal produced a
  reason of exactly 220 characters that named two ids and cut off mid-list, so
  the audit was least informative in exactly the cases where the most was being
  removed. The structured fields are bounded by count, like `sourceIds`, rather
  than by slicing the middle out of the payload.

- **The shortfall check no longer disarms itself at the display cap.** It
  compared against `manifest.sourceIds`, truncated at `MAX_SOURCE_IDS` (20) for
  the bounded audit record, and skipped the comparison outright once
  `sourceIdsTruncated` was set. With a canonical set of 19 the guard was one
  rule away from silently reporting nothing missing, forever. Comparison now
  uses a new uncapped `readManifestSourceIds()`; the audit record stays bounded.

- **Deleting or corrupting one file no longer disarms the preservation floor
  (todos `8776dba9`).** The floor above reads exactly one input —
  `<profile.dir>/.hasna/session-render-manifest.json` — and
  `readManifestSourceIds()` returned a bare `string[]`, answering `[]` for four
  different conditions: no manifest, unparseable JSON, a malformed `sources`
  field, and a manifest legitimately declaring none. Only the last is a
  trustworthy zero, and the caller treated all four as "this home has nothing to
  protect". A bare `catch { return [] }` on the sole input to a safety control
  is the defect.

  Reproduced on station01 2026-08-01 against published `0.2.31`, on a scratch
  profile carrying 7 sources against a stale 4-source export: with the manifest
  corrupted **or** deleted, the render was issued, the audit recorded
  `result: applied`, manifest drift read `ok`, and the home dropped to 4
  sources. Every gate green. That is the failure `c461ce8a` had just closed,
  re-armed by one missing file.

  `readManifestSourceIds()` now returns `{ state, ids }` with
  `state: "ok" | "missing" | "unreadable"`, so a caller can no longer fail to
  notice that its input was destroyed. The guard resolves the floor in order:
  the manifest; failing that, the **prelaunch audit** at
  `.hasna/accounts/prelaunch-status.json`, which `accounts` writes on every run
  and is a second, independently produced record of the same set; failing both,
  it **refuses the render** and says so, unless nothing on disk claims the home
  has ever carried sources — the first-ever render of a new profile stays open.

  The audit now carries an uncapped `preservationFloor` independently of its
  bounded manifest summary, and carries that floor forward when a skipped or
  failed run observes the manifest missing. That prevents an intermediate run
  from erasing the fallback before the next render. Legacy audit records remain
  capped until one successful render refreshes the durable floor.
  `--allow-instruction-reduction` bypasses the new refusal, so an operator with
  a corrupt manifest is never wedged out of their own launch.

- **A stale audit can no longer make a non-empty instruction home look fresh
  (todos `328064bc`).** The prior fallback trusted any non-empty audit id list,
  even when its count was stale or its bounded list was explicitly truncated;
  it also treated a zero-source audit plus a missing manifest as a first render.
  A replicated account005 shape — 20 rendered source files, an audit remembering
  3, a deleted manifest, and a 4-source export — therefore issued the renderer
  and reduced the home while reporting the incumbent guard as armed.

  The fallback now rejects truncated or count-mismatched audit records and
  compares their claimed count with the independent per-source files under
  `.hasna/instructions`. If more rendered files remain than the audit remembers,
  the render is refused before the renderer is called. This disk check is what
  distinguishes the affected live homes from the correct first-render path,
  which has neither an instructions directory nor a primary instruction file.

## [0.2.30] - 2026-08-01

Ships the alias capability, which was merged after `0.2.29` had already been
published and so had never reached an installed binary. Release span measured
against the bytes `0.2.29` actually shipped rather than against its tag: the
`npm/accounts/v0.2.29` tag points at `0791af29`, but the published `0.2.29`
artifact was cut from `3e5a7791`, two commits later — verified by finding
`purgeProfileDir` (from `c3798bcd`) and `claimed by more than one profile`
(from `3e5a7791`) in the published `dist/cli.js`, not merely in its packaged
`CHANGELOG.md`. The eight commits new in `0.2.30` are therefore `0944c23e`,
`8f62e684`, `28e319d5`, `613450c7`, `5ac06e44`, `ce2215b8`, `9f00b7db` and
`e0303603`.

### Added

- **Alias records: a rename is recorded, not just performed (R-P1-4).**
  Profiles gain two optional fields: `nativeName` (the tool-native/on-disk
  name, when it differs from the registry `name`) and `aliases` (former
  registry names this profile has answered to). `accounts show <old-name>`
  now prints a disambiguation line naming the OTHER record that used to be
  called that, instead of silently resolving only the exact-name match and
  looking like the old name answers to nothing else. Write path:
  `accounts set <name> --native-name <value> --alias <old-name>` (repeatable;
  appends, never replaces). Cloud storage: migration `0007_alias_records`
  adds `accounts.native_name`/`accounts.aliases` (JSONB). Deliberately NOT
  wired into `accounts rename` automatically, and does not backfill the 13
  records renamed by the earlier accounts-debloat migration — both are
  separate, tracked work.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: `registry --backfill-uuid` could silently write one `accountUuid`
  onto multiple profiles.** `planAccountUuidBackfill` planned each profile in
  isolation, so two directories that independently resolved the SAME parked
  identity both read as clean, confirmed `backfilled` rows and
  `summary.conflict` reported `0` throughout. Measured live: one uuid proposed
  for three profiles, a second for two more, with no conflict surfaced. A uuid
  now claimed by more than one profile in the same plan is downgraded to the
  existing `conflict` outcome for every row involved (never applied); unrelated,
  unambiguous rows in the same plan are unaffected. Fixed in two passes: a
  uuid proposed by more than one FRESH backfill, and (found in review) a uuid
  already RECORDED on one profile that a different profile's fresh backfill
  also independently resolves to — the second is reachable the moment any
  profile has been backfilled once, through the tool's own
  dry-run → apply → re-run workflow. (task `2b15400e`)

  **This code already shipped inside the `0.2.29` artifact** and is logged here
  only because `0.2.29` was a manual publish cut from `3e5a7791`, a head two
  commits ahead of the tag it was released under, so its own changelog section
  never described it. Recorded rather than silently relocated: an entry that
  moves between versions is otherwise indistinguishable from a regression.

## [0.2.29] - 2026-07-31

The first release intended to go through the release workflow rather than
around it. Every version since `0.2.22` reached npm by break-glass, because the
workflow had **never succeeded** — three runs (`0.2.24`, `0.2.25`, `0.2.28`) all
died at the provisioning gate for a credential that could not be provisioned in
the form the contract asked for.

### Fixed

- **The release lane could not complete, and each of its three blockers hid the
  next.** `RELEASE_GITHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN` was specified as a stored personal token.
  Substituting a GitHub App installation token is not a drop-in: a stored one
  expires in about an hour, so it would pass a presence check forever and then
  fail as an authorization error. It is now **minted per run** and the presence
  gate moved to `RELEASE_APP_ID` / `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, which still fails
  by name.

  Minting alone was not sufficient. The preflight identified that credential by
  calling `GET /user` and asserting the identity equalled the release actor —
  unsatisfiable in principle, because an installation token has no user identity
  and that endpoint answers `403 Resource not accessible by integration` for
  every one. The credential is now bound by **scope** instead:
  `GET /installation/repositories` must return exactly one repository and it must
  be the release repository. Narrower than the token it replaces — a personal
  token carries everything its owner can reach for as long as it lives; this
  carries one repository for about an hour.

  And `workflowIdentity()` still required an environment variable the workflow
  had stopped exporting, so the run aborted before any of that executed, with an
  error naming a credential the design deliberately no longer stores.

- **The tag ruleset is now verified by a credential that cannot author it.** The
  minted token is pinned to `administration: read` + `metadata: read` — down from
  the roughly 35 scopes an unpinned token inherits. `administration: write` was
  measured creating a repository ruleset, which would have made the attestation
  tautological: proof that the protections exist *and* that the reader could have
  created them. Because GitHub returns `bypass_actors` only to `write`, the
  release no longer enumerates bypass actors; it asserts via
  `current_user_can_bypass` that it cannot itself bypass the ruleset, and the
  "no other actor holds a bypass" property is audited out of band.

### Changed

- `docs/RELEASING.md` now describes what the release verifies **and what it
  deliberately does not**, rather than implying full coverage. Its long-standing
  "Administration read" specification was measured insufficient for the check it
  was written for.
- Regression coverage for the class that let all of this ship: a test derives the
  set of `*_CONFIGURED` flags from `release.yml` and from `release-provenance.ts`
  and requires them to be equal, so workflow/script drift cannot pass a green
  suite again.

## [0.2.28] - 2026-07-31

`0.2.27` was published break-glass from a tree that was never merged, so `main`
carried `version: 0.2.26` while npm served `0.2.27`. This release reconciles the
two and ships the b29f5b6c fix.

### Fixed

- **A launched Claude session could read a logged-out profile while `accounts login`
  reported it logged-in** (b29f5b6c). The profile-root `.credentials.json` — the file
  a launched session reads via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — held Claude Code's own
  `rotated-away` husk (empty tokens, scopes intact), written in place after a
  DUPLICATE live copy of the same account rotated the refresh token out from under
  it, while the profile's snapshot and the central store still held the real
  credential. `profileEnv`'s heal refused to restore it with `account-live-elsewhere`
  (defect bb267228) — correct for a blind restore of a possibly-superseded
  predecessor token, but it left the directory logged-out.

  The launch path now heals by **convergence** instead: `convergeDirCredential`
  performs no token exchange and fans the current winning credential into every
  copy, so all directories end holding the SAME token rather than a second,
  superseded one.

  The heal is **narrowed to legitimate duplicate doors**. `account-live-elsewhere`
  conflates a directory that OWNS the account and is running it with one owned by a
  DIFFERENT account that is merely carrying it after an in-place switch; converging
  through the latter would cross a custody boundary its real owner never consented
  to. `accountGuestOccupantDoorsElsewhere` ranges over the UNFILTERED
  current-occupant set — the same doors the broker's fan-out targets — so a guest
  directory holding a husk cannot hide from the gate, and a single guest anywhere in
  that set stops the heal. The bb267228 launch gate is preserved, not worked around.

### Known limitations

- A profile whose directory currently presents a DIFFERENT account
  (`identity-would-change`) is deliberately not healed: restoring there would change
  which account the directory presents. Tracked as `6824d0b3`.
- `convergeDirCredential` itself still writes through a guest directory with no
  ownership gate, and the usage hook calls it unconditionally. Pre-existing and not
  widened by this release; tracked as `96e80483`.
- A guest directory whose own binding snapshot is CORRUPT is classified as an owner
  by the identity index, so it is not reported as a guest. Unreachable on the
  measured fleet and independently guarded by the switch marker; tracked as
  `67163aa4`.

## [0.2.26] - 2026-07-30

`0.2.25` was prepared (#91) but never published to npm: #93 landed on `main`
after the release commit, so the tree carrying `version: 0.2.25` contained
behaviour that the `0.2.25` entry below does not describe. Rather than amend a
released version's notes to cover code it never announced, `0.2.25` is retired
unpublished and this entry ships that tree plus #93. `0.2.26` therefore contains
everything listed under `0.2.25` as well as the fix below.

### Fixed

- **An occupied profile dir no longer reports `ok`** (`src/lib/readiness.ts`,
  `src/cli.ts`). `#63` already detected in-place account switches and emitted
  `dirOccupiedByAnotherAccount: true`, but it left `status` alone — so the same
  payload said the dir was occupied *and* said `status: "ok"`, and every
  consumer that reads a verdict rather than a flag was told the profile was
  fine. Measured on station01: five profiles reporting `ok` that
  `accounts launch` refused **by name**. A health check that disagrees with the
  launch path is worse than no health check, because the disagreement is
  invisible until a launch fails. An occupied dir now grades `degraded` — not
  `unavailable`, because the profile's own credential is parked and intact, so
  it is one reconcile away from usable rather than broken.

- **`accounts show` now displays the reason a launch would be refused**
  (`src/cli.ts`). `accounts launch account031` refused with "its config dir
  currently carries the account of account029" while
  `accounts show account031 --json` displayed the correct dir, the correct
  email, and no mention of `account029` anywhere — the CLI refused for a reason
  its own inspection command would not show, which made the state
  undiagnosable from outside. `show` now carries a `switchedAway` field (JSON)
  and a `switched:` line (human output) naming the occupying profile and the
  exact reconcile command.

## [0.2.25] - 2026-07-30 [unpublished — superseded by 0.2.26]

### Fixed

- **Agents no longer launch into instruction homes that carry no rules**
  (`src/lib/configs-prelaunch.ts`, `src/cli.ts`). `accounts launch <profile>`
  appended `--allow-empty-sources` to the session render whenever a profile had
  no identity export — the normal state of every pooled `accountNNN` profile —
  which disarmed the renderer's own guard against rendering nothing. The render
  then wrote a rules-free home, exited 0, produced a well-formed manifest, and
  was recorded as `applied`. Twenty-six agent homes on one station carried a
  four-line index with no operating rules, no review policy and no safety text,
  and every surface reported them healthy. `--allow-empty-sources` is now opt-in
  (`--allow-empty-instructions`); zero resolvable sources SKIP the render,
  leaving the existing home intact and letting the launch proceed rather than
  emptying the home or aborting every pooled launch; and a partial render is
  rejected, not only an empty one, since one profile had been rendering 3 of 10
  sources while looking identical to success. These outcomes are recorded as
  skipped/bypassed rather than applied, so `accounts health` can fail on a
  rules-free or partial home instead of reporting `configs: ok`.

- **A Claude credential the tool renews on use is no longer reported as
  unavailable** (`src/lib/readiness.ts`, `src/lib/claude-auth.ts`). An access
  token that has aged out while its refresh token is intact is the normal
  resting state of a parked account and self-heals on first use, but readiness
  collapsed every non-ok status to `unavailable` and never emitted `renewable`
  at all, so a pool manager could not tell "needs a human" from "renews
  itself". One pool fell from 21 usable profiles to 11 on that basis; none of
  the ten held out needed re-authenticating. `renewable` is now emitted, no
  longer requires a recorded past expiry, and grades such a profile `degraded`.
  A credential file that exists but carries no OAuth payload — a literal empty
  JSON object — no longer counts as a payload being present; it reads as
  `missing`, which routes it to a human instead of leaving it in a no-verdict
  state that was never quarantined, never cleared, and still auto-pickable.

### Added

- **Credential broker: an account can now be shared by any number of sessions —
  many readers, one writer** (`accounts credential-sync`,
  `src/lib/credential-broker.ts`, `src/lib/identity-lock.ts`). Every stored
  copy of an account's credential (central store, profile snapshots, live
  config dirs) converges on the newest rotation under a per-account
  cross-process lock, and the `grant_type=refresh_token` exchange is performed
  once, by one writer, with the rotation atomically persisted to the central
  store first and fanned out after. Ported from the codewith lineage:
  iapp-infinity's subscription broker (per-credential mkdir mutex,
  re-read-under-lock, rotation-only atomic persist) over codewith's shared
  auth.json optimistic-concurrency model. The `usage-hook` runs a convergence
  pass before every prompt and spawns a detached `credential-sync
  --ensure-fresh` when the access token nears expiry, so sessions essentially
  never trigger the tool's own uncoordinated refresh.

### Changed

- `ACCOUNTS_HOME` now selects the local registry ahead of an inherited
  `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_URL` + `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_KEY` pair, preventing scoped
  agent and probe runs from silently reaching the production API. An explicit
  `self_hosted` or `cloud` storage mode remains authoritative.
- **The usage hook no longer refuses accounts that are live in another
  session.** The `contended` exclusion — "already being run by another session
  and cannot be shared — a second copy would get its token rotated away" — is
  removed: the hazard it guarded against (two independent credential copies
  behind one rotating refresh token) is dissolved by the credential broker
  rather than avoided by refusal. A switch onto a shared account is announced
  in the switch message. `switch-account` converges the target account's
  credential before writing, so a switch installs the account's credential of
  record, never a superseded predecessor. The identity gates are untouched: a
  foreign account's credential still never lands over a profile's park, and
  `repair-auth` still refuses to restore a park while the account is live
  elsewhere.

- **Behaviour change to the published package root — read this before releasing.**
  The synchronous registry exports from `@hasna/accounts` (as opposed to
  `resolveStore()`, `@hasna/accounts/storage`, the CLI, the MCP server or the
  SDK, none of which change) are now explicit local-only v1 compatibility, and
  behave differently when hosted authority is configured
  (`HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_URL` + `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_API_KEY`, or an explicit
  `cloud`/`self_hosted` storage mode):
  - **Writes now throw** before any local I/O: `saveStore`, `addProfile`,
    `removeProfile`, `renameProfile`, `updateProfile`, `redetectEmail`,
    `useProfile`, `lockProfileTool`, `addCustomTool`, `removeCustomTool`, and
    the deprecated `ensureProfileForLogin`. Such a write would land in the
    machine's local JSON file while the registry of record is elsewhere.
  - **Reads are unchanged in what they return** — `loadStore`, `listTools`,
    `getTool`, `listProfiles`, `findProfile`, `getProfile`,
    `getProfileToolLock`, `currentProfile`, `appliedProfile` still answer from
    the machine-local registry — but now emit a `DeprecationWarning` with code
    `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_LOCAL_COMPAT_READ`, once per operation per process.
  - `appliedProfileName` is exempt in every mode; it returns only the
    machine-local applied pointer, never a registry record.
  - `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_STRICT_ROOT_COMPAT=1` opts a process into the end state,
    where reads throw as well. Do not set it fleet-wide until every root-import
    consumer has moved to `resolveStore()` or `@hasna/accounts/v2`:
    `@hasna/economy` (0.3.7) resolves per-agent cost attribution through these
    reads and wraps every call in `try {} catch {}`, so a throw there is not a
    loud failure — it is a silent loss of attribution.
  Migration: async v1 callers use `resolveStore()`; new callers use
  `@hasna/accounts/v2`. Rationale and the fleet measurement are in
  `docs/V2_FOUNDATION.md`.

- Storage-mode precedence no longer lets a retired mode word mask a canonical
  one. `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_STORAGE_MODE`, `ACCOUNTS_STORAGE_MODE` and
  `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_MODE` are scanned in that order and a retired
  `remote`/`hybrid`/`s3` value is skipped as absent authority instead of
  stopping the scan. Previously a retired word on a higher-precedence key
  suppressed every lower one and fell through to local. A machine that sets a
  retired word on a higher-precedence key *and* `local`/`self_hosted`/`cloud`
  on a lower one therefore changes storage authority on upgrade; a machine that
  sets at most one mode key is unaffected.

### Added

- `@hasna/accounts/v2` subpath export: a scoped, contract-first registry
  foundation (`AccountsRegistry` domain, local/HTTP/PostgreSQL adapters,
  machine binding). Nothing routes through it yet — it ships as a foundation
  for the later wire/schema migration slice. See `docs/V2_FOUNDATION.md`.

- Profile-dir policy for the cloud registry (`src/lib/profile-dir-policy.ts`).
  `POST /v1/accounts` and `PATCH /v1/accounts/:tool/:name` now refuse a `dir`
  that sits under an ephemeral root (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/var/folders`,
  `/dev/shm`, `/run`, and the macOS `/private` aliases), is not anchored under a
  home root, or does not sit in a tool home directory. Previously any string was
  accepted, which let test harnesses and agents write throwaway paths into the
  shared registry. The check is deliberately filesystem-free — the service
  validates dirs belonging to other machines and must judge them lexically — and
  the ephemeral check runs before the home check, so widening
  `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_PROFILE_DIR_ROOTS` for an unusual machine layout cannot
  re-admit a temp path. Enforcement is server-side only: the cloud client also
  talks to test doubles and non-production instances and cannot know which, so
  it does not judge dirs locally.

- Central identity-keyed auth snapshot store (`docs/auth-store.md`):
  `~/.hasna/accounts/auth/<accountUuid>/{credentials.json,oauth-account.json}`
  replaces the per-profile `.accounts-auth/` dirs as the canonical credential
  home, with a read-both/write-new compatibility window for <= 0.2.15
  binaries (writes mirrored to both stores, reads pick the `betterCredential`
  winner, nothing deleted). New CLI: `accounts auth status | migrate | sweep`
  (sweep is dry-run by default, refuses in api storage mode, and only ever
  MOVES orphaned entries to `auth-trash/`). `buildIdentityIndex()` and the
  central-store surface are exported from the package root.

- Usage-aware automatic account switching (`docs/usage-aware-switching.md`):
  - `accounts usage` — per-ACCOUNT usage from Claude's `/api/oauth/usage`
    (`Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` + `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`),
    keyed on `oauthAccount.accountUuid` and deduplicated across profile dirs —
    one query per distinct account however many dirs hold it. Reports session
    and weekly windows (structured `limits[]` preferred), headroom
    (100 − worst unscoped window), expired/credential-less accounts as states
    (never crashes), and caches per uuid under `cache/usage/`.
  - `accounts pick --healthiest` — non-interactive selector: the account with
    the most headroom, never the one the session currently runs as (the
    silent-no-op case), resolved to a profile door; reports "all limited"
    honestly instead of flapping. No identity exclusions (user-ratified
    2026-07-28: switching across all client identities is fine).
  - `accounts usage-hook` — a Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` handler that
    auto-switches the session in place (via `switch-account`) when any
    unscoped window crosses the threshold (default 90% used). Cached-only
    decisions with a detached background refresh (never blocks a prompt),
    fail-open on every error, cooldown against flapping, loud `systemMessage`
    announcements for switches AND failed switches, and a mandatory
    post-switch assertion that the active `accountUuid` actually changed.
    NOT installed automatically — `--print-install` prints the settings.json
    snippet for operator opt-in.
  - Identity enumeration lives behind one accessor
    (`buildIdentityIndex()`), reading the future central auth home
    `~/.hasna/accounts/auth/<accountUuid>/` first with per-profile
    `.accounts-auth/` fallback, ready for the auth-store migration.

- Two-window (5-hour session vs 7-day weekly) rate-limit selection. Anthropic
  enforces two independent limits that fail differently, and the selector
  previously ranked accounts on a single blended headroom
  (100 − worst unscoped window) — which scores an account whose 5-hour window
  is spent but recovers in minutes identically to one that is dead until next
  week. Both windows are now carried separately end to end:
  - `src/lib/usage-windows.ts` classifies each window from the payload's
    `group` discriminator (measured live 2026-07-28 across 8 accounts:
    `kind=session group=session`, `kind=weekly_all group=weekly`,
    `kind=weekly_scoped group=weekly scoped`), falling back to `kind` and then
    to a deliberately ASYMMETRIC reset-horizon rule — a horizon over the
    session window's 5-hour maximum implies weekly, but a short horizon does
    NOT imply session (a live `weekly_all` window was measured 0.86h from its
    reset). Horizon-derived classes are flagged `inferred`.
  - `selectHealthiestAccount` excludes weekly-exhausted accounts until their
    weekly reset and session-exhausted accounts only until their 5-hour roll,
    reporting a per-account reason and `eligibleAt`; survivors rank by weekly
    headroom, then session headroom, then uuid. A window whose `resets_at` has
    passed since the reading is re-read as recovered (INFERRED), which is what
    lets an account return without a fresh fetch; a `resets_at` already past at
    read time is treated as a malformed payload, not a roll. New
    `--min-session-headroom` / `ACCOUNTS_USAGE_SWITCH_MIN_SESSION_HEADROOM`
    floor (default 10) keeps switches off targets with no immediate runway.
  - `state/exhaustion-ledger.json` — restart-durable per-account cooldowns
    with exponential backoff (15 min base, doubling), released at the later of
    the reported reset and the backoff step, capped at 5h (session/unknown) and
    24h (weekly) so a misclassified window can never retire an account
    permanently. Corrupt or path-hostile entries degrade to "no cooldown".
  - The switch announcement and `accounts usage` now report both windows rather
    than one blended percentage. `accounts usage` labels each window with its
    class and marks a window whose reset has passed as reset rather than
    printing a stale "100% used" the selector disagrees with.
  - `accounts pick --healthiest` reads the same exhaustion ledger the hook
    writes, so the CLI and the hook no longer disagree about the pool.
  - Exhaustion is decided by utilization alone; `severity` is not consulted.
    Measured in the Claude Code 2.1.220 bundle (binary-safe): `severity:"normal"`
    0, `severity:"critical"` 0, `severity:"exhausted"` 0, against positive
    controls on the same file of `severity:"error"` 27, `"warning"` 22,
    `"fatal"` 6 and bare `severity` 295. The reference client reads `kind`,
    `scope`, `percent`, `resets_at` and `extra_usage.*` off a limit entry and
    never reads `severity` from the usage payload.
  - The ledger lives under `state/`, not `cache/` — a store whose purpose is
    surviving restarts must not sit in a directory whose name licenses
    deletion. (Motivated by a live observation that
    `cache/auto-switch-state.json` is absent despite two switches 60s apart
    under a 10-minute cooldown; the cause of that loss is NOT established and
    is tracked separately.) No migration: nothing was ever released writing
    the old path.

- `accounts switch-account [name]` — switch the CURRENT Claude Code session's
  account in place, with no restart and the conversation intact. Measured on
  Claude Code 2.1.220: a running session `stat()`s `<configDir>/.credentials.json`
  on every API request and re-reads it when the mtime changes (the stat sits
  above the token-still-valid early return, inside the per-request client
  factory) — so installing another profile's credentials +
  `oauthAccount` into the session's config dir flips its identity on the next
  message. The verb snapshots the dir's outgoing credentials back to their owning
  profile first, records a `switched-account` marker so snapshot machinery never
  cross-contaminates profiles, refuses dead-auth targets loudly before touching
  anything, and refuses config dirs shared by multiple live sessions without
  `--yes` (they all flip together). The live default dir routes through the
  existing `apply` semantics.

### Fixed

- Purge the leaked `fake-login`, `fake-variant`, `missing-review`, and
  `review-state-shape` test tools (and their dependent fixture profiles) from
  the production PostgreSQL registry. Migration `0006` tombstones the ids so
  legacy account writers cannot recreate them implicitly.

- Share capabilities across profiles instead of isolating them. A profile is an
  isolated config dir, so pointing Claude Code at a freshly created one gave it
  none of the machine's skills, subagents, or MCP servers — only credentials are
  meant to be per-profile. `skills/` and `agents/` are now linked to the tool's
  shared home and user-scope `mcpServers` are merged into the profile's account
  file, both idempotently, on profile creation and on every launch (so profiles
  created by earlier versions are repaired the next time they are used). Which
  entries and keys are shared is per-tool data (`ToolDef.sharedEntries` /
  `ToolDef.sharedConfig`), not a hard-coded Claude mapping.

- Never rebuild a profile's account file from an unreadable one. A `.claude.json`
  that exists but does not parse is now reported and left byte-for-byte intact;
  previously it was treated as an empty object and replaced by the merge result,
  destroying `oauthAccount`, `userID` and `machineID`.
- Write the merged account file atomically (temp file, `fsync`, `rename`, explicit
  `chmod`) instead of truncating a ~200 KB credential-bearing file in place. The
  shared primitive now backs `saveStore` too. `writeFileSync`'s `mode` does not
  tighten a pre-existing file, so the mode is applied after the rename.
- Take shared MCP server definitions from rendered config before templated
  config, union members across all declared sources instead of letting the first
  non-empty file win outright, and drop any server whose definition still carries
  an unsubstituted `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`. `secrets` is excluded from sharing.
- Materialize shared capabilities from `accounts switch` as well. In applied mode
  it skips `profileEnv`, so the headline way to change Claude profiles used to
  leave the profile dir unrepaired for later isolated launches.

### Changed

- `accounts doctor` now checks capability sharing by realpath, so a profile with
  no skills, no subagents, no MCP servers, or a dangling capability link is
  reported as a problem instead of a green check.
- `accounts doctor` also fails when a shared corpus has shrunk below the size
  recorded when it was linked. Realpath equality only proves the pointer is
  correct; it says nothing about whether a write-through delete emptied the
  corpus. `accounts doctor --accept-capability-baseline` accepts a deliberate
  deletion as the new floor.
- Tool definitions may not declare credential artifacts (`.credentials.json`,
  `auth.json`, `keychain.json`, …) as shared entries or as a merge target, may not
  share credential-bearing config keys (`oauthAccount`, `customApiKeyResponses`,
  …), and may not contain control characters in shared paths. Tool definitions can
  arrive from a registry, so this is enforced in the schema rather than by
  convention.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Add the read-only `accounts sessions` / `accounts sessions list` catalog for
  Claude sessions represented by verified Accounts-managed profiles. The
  command provides deterministic table and JSON views with bounded metadata;
  it performs no application writes to session or profile trees, never writes
  credential or transcript content, and never emits credentials, prompts,
  messages, or transcript content. Read-only fallback may update filesystem
  access-time metadata when `O_NOATIME` is unavailable or not permitted.

### Changed

- Derive canonical `catalogRef` values from the physical storage/session tuple
  instead of mutable account metadata. Managed roots remain visible across
  account renames, multiple account records for the same root are
  deduplicated, and the resolver accepts the deterministic v1 references
  exposed through `catalogRefAliases`.
- Harden the bundled MCP build graph by pinning patched `fast-uri` and `hono`
  versions, keeping its validation dependencies out of clean consumer
  installs, enforcing high-severity dependency audits in CI, and extending
  Bun's release-age quarantine to seven days.

### Fixed

- Keep large JSON output complete under Bun, format large built-package tables
  without overflowing Node's call-argument ceiling, treat a closed stdout pipe
  as a normal exit, preserve settled entries while session trees churn, and
  isolate Windows home-directory fixtures so the portable suite exercises the
  intended managed roots.

### Not Included

- The cross-owner continuation broker is not part of 0.2.12. It remains
  fail-closed and unreleased; this release provides read-only discovery only.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-07-24

### Testing

- Regression coverage locking `--allow-empty-sources` onto the `accounts run` /
  supervisor codewith configs-prelaunch path for identity-less profiles (e.g.
  `accountNNN`): `runSupervisedTool` now has an explicit test asserting the
  `configs session apply` invocation carries `--allow-empty-sources` (and no
  `--identity-export`) when zero identity exports resolve, plus a direct
  `runConfigsPrelaunch` test for the shared apply path. The behavior itself
  shipped in 0.2.9 via the shared `configsPrelaunchCommand` (used by `launch`,
  `run`, and the supervisor); stations still dead-lettering with "Session render
  has no instruction sources" are running a pre-0.2.9 binary and need the
  package update, not a code change.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Test suite is now isolated from live environments: keychain platform/security
  resolution is factored into pure, injectable helpers (`keychainSupportedFor`,
  `securityExecutableFor`) and the PostgreSQL integration tests run through a
  signal-safe launcher (`test/run-postgres.ts`) that tears down its controlled
  root on SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP. No runtime behavior change for the CLI.

### Documentation

- Documented the accounts runtime entrypoints in the README.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Configs prelaunch now performs an explicit empty session render for profiles
  with no instruction sources. When accounts resolves zero identity exports for a
  `configs session plan`/`apply`, it appends `--allow-empty-sources` so `configs`
  writes a valid empty render (`CLAUDE.md` + a `sourceCount: 0` manifest, exit 0)
  instead of failing closed. This unblocks `accounts launch` / `accounts run` for
  identity-less profiles (e.g. `accountNNN`), which previously aborted with
  `configs prelaunch apply failed ... Session render has no instruction sources`.
  Profiles that resolve one or more instruction sources are unchanged and never
  receive the flag.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- `accounts launch` and `accounts run` treat Claude-only convenience modes as
  thin native relays:
  `--headless` relays native print mode, while `--background`/`--bg` and an
  optional validated `--name` relay exactly to Claude's native `--bg --name`
  lifecycle. Claude remains the owner of session ids, status, logs, attach, and
  stop behavior.
- Explicit `cloud` and `self_hosted` modes now fail closed when API
  configuration is incomplete. Cold custom-tool login/import/launch paths
  hydrate before synchronous lookup.
- Pull requests run a checksum-pinned gitleaks binary over the complete
  base-to-head commit range with read-only repository permissions and fully
  redacted output.
- Deprecated storage exports and CLI commands remain as compatibility shims;
  retired provider-backed sync operations preserve optional environment
  arguments and `--json` parsing, then fail explicitly.
- Release provenance identifies the source repository as
  `hasna/accounts-legacy`.

### Fixed

- Account rename/remove reconciles raw machine-local pointers. PostgreSQL
  selection updates are protected by row locks and an additive cascading
  foreign key migration. Migration `0004` archives orphan selections before
  cleanup, and the migrator rejects unknown applied migrations before its
  privilege-safe no-op path.
- Custom-tool add/remove and account creation share a transaction-scoped
  advisory lock, preventing tool deletion from racing a new dependent account.
  Additive migration `0005` durably distinguishes unseen legacy custom tool
  ids from explicitly removed ids, including for older direct SQL writers.
- Migration `0005` trigger functions remain owner-controlled
  `SECURITY INVOKER` functions with a fixed schema-safe `search_path` and no
  public execution. The owner-run migrator validates and applies an explicit
  DML-only `accounts-serve` role contract.
- Validate raw, convenience, alias, duplicate, name, and explicit session UUID
  conflicts before configs prelaunch, active-profile mutation, keychain access,
  or process launch. Noninteractive invocations neither select a profile nor
  inherit `ACCOUNTS_ACTIVE`.
- Serialize temporary macOS keychain use across processes and restore the prior
  credential after Claude confirms dispatch or exits, including launch errors
  and forwarded termination signals. Lock files contain no credential values.
- Resolve Claude from Windows `PATH`/`PATHEXT`, invoke only resolved `.cmd` and
  `.bat` shims through `cmd.exe` with line-break rejection and escaped
  arguments, and keep native executables on the direct-spawn path.
- Keep Claude stdout unmodified, send Accounts diagnostics to stderr, preserve
  Claude exit status, and map forwarded termination signals to nonzero exits.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- First-class Claude worker flags on `accounts launch` and `accounts run`:
  `--headless` maps to Claude `-p`, `--background` / `--bg` maps to Claude
  `--bg`, and `--name <name>` names a background Claude agent. These flags compose
  with `--permissions dangerous`, leaving the existing `-- ...` passthrough path
  intact for raw Claude options.
- Regression coverage for Claude worker argument placement, passthrough
  de-duplication, and invalid flag combinations so dangerous permissions continue
  to appear before worker-mode args.

### Changed

- The package repository metadata now points at `hasna/accounts-legacy`, the
  current source home for the launcher-era `@hasna/accounts` npm package. The
  clean `hasna/accounts` repository is a separate capacity-service product line.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **`accounts-serve` OpenAPI `Tool` response schema is wire-additive again.** The
  refactor that enriched `GET /v1/tools` (returning the full `ToolDef` plus custom
  tools from the cloud registry) had also grown the `Tool` schema's `required` set
  to `["id","label","envVar","defaultDir","bin"]`. The deployed (0.1.x) server only
  guaranteed `["id","label"]` and never emitted `defaultDir`, so the change was a
  non-additive contract narrowing that the server-redeploy safety gate blocked. The
  extra `ToolDef` fields are now documented as **optional** and `required` is back to
  `["id","label"]`, making the HTTP response contract a strict SUPERSET of the
  deployed version. Runtime behavior is unchanged (the handler still returns the full
  `ToolDef` + custom tools); old `/v1` clients — which parse the response without
  strict validation — keep working. No route was removed or renamed; the new
  `rename` / custom-tool endpoints remain additive alongside the old surface.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Clear diagnostic when the self-hosted server predates an endpoint.** When a
  mutating registry call (`accounts rename`, `accounts tools add`, `accounts
  tools remove`) hits a route-missing `404` (`{ "error": "not found" }`) — the
  signature of a deployed `accounts-serve` build older than the client — the CLI
  now surfaces an actionable message instructing the operator to redeploy
  `accounts-serve`, instead of a raw HTTP failure. Entity-level `404`s (a real
  "no profile"/"no custom tool") are unchanged and never masked. Local mode is
  unaffected. (The rename + tools endpoints already exist in `src/server`; the
  live fix for cloud mode is an ECS redeploy of `accounts-serve` to >= 0.2.4.)

## [0.1.32] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Cloud service surface (`accounts-serve`)**: an HTTP API for the accounts
  registry. `GET /health`, `/ready`, `/version` plus API-key-authenticated
  versioned CRUD under `/v1` (`accounts`, `current` selection, `tools`).
  PURE REMOTE per Amendment A1 — reads/writes go directly to the app's cloud
  Postgres via the vendored `@hasna/contracts` storage kit; no local cache.
- **API-key auth** via `@hasna/contracts/auth` (`verifyApiKey`, `ApiKeyStore`):
  `accounts:read` for GETs, `accounts:write` for mutations; per-request audit.
- **Generated SDK (`@hasna/accounts/sdk`)**: a typed, dependency-free fetch
  client generated from the `accounts-serve` OpenAPI document, plus
  `createAccountsClientFromEnv()` (`ACCOUNTS_API_URL` + `ACCOUNTS_API_KEY`).
- **Migrations**: `migrations/*.sql` + the `accounts-migrate` bin/runner
  (checksum-guarded ledger, privilege-safe readiness probe).
- **Deploy assets**: ARM64 Bun `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and
  `hasna.contract.json` service manifest.

## [0.1.30] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- `accounts launch`, `accounts shell`, `accounts env`, `accounts switch`, MCP
  `switch_profile`, and supervised Claude starts now
  best-effort sync the selected profile's file credentials into the macOS
  `Claude Code-credentials` keychain item before spawning Claude. This prevents
  GUI-launched Claude from preferring a stale global keychain login over the
  selected profile's valid `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` credentials.
- Applying a Claude profile now synthesizes the macOS keychain payload from the
  profile credential snapshot when no explicit keychain snapshot exists.
- Stale keychain snapshots no longer override fresher profile file credentials.
- Re-applying the same Claude profile no longer snapshots newer but unusable
  live credentials over a profile's valid refresh-token credentials.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- `accounts login <name>` now prompts for a registry-driven tool choice when a
  profile name is not already locked, including built-in and custom registered
  tool variants.
- Profile names now persist a selected tool lock so bare `login`, `show`, `use`,
  and `launch` commands resolve to the chosen tool when duplicate names exist
  across tools.

### Fixed

- Missing Cursor installs are handled before launching `cursor-agent`, with
  accounts-level guidance to choose another tool, keep Cursor selected with
  install instructions, or cancel without partial state.
- Non-interactive login commands now fail clearly with explicit `--tool`
  commands instead of waiting on prompts.

## [0.1.28] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Claude apply-mode handoff commands now use live/default auth instead of
  relaunching with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, preventing restarts into isolated
  profile dirs that Claude reports as logged out.
- Applying a Claude profile no longer fails solely because macOS denies a
  non-interactive keychain write when file credentials were already restored.

## [0.1.27] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Claude keychain operations now call `/usr/bin/security` on macOS, avoiding
  failures when another `security` CLI appears earlier in `PATH`.
- `accounts apply` and Claude auto-switching now reject OAuth-only profiles
  without restorable credentials instead of marking them applied and launching
  a logged-out Claude session.

## [0.1.26] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Native macOS Codex App menu-bar switcher via `accounts codex-app menubar`,
  backed by JSON state/switch helpers that list `codex-app` profiles, mark the
  active profile, and safely quit/relaunch Codex.app under the selected profile.

### Fixed

- `accounts login <name>` now prefers an existing Claude profile when a profile
  name is shared with other tools, so bare Claude account login commands keep
  working without `--tool`.

## [0.1.25] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- `accounts login <name>` now reuses an existing unambiguous profile before
  creating a login profile, avoiding misleading duplicate Claude profile errors.

## [0.1.24] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Codex App profile preparation now normalizes existing root
  `cli_auth_credentials_store` settings to `file` without duplicating the TOML
  key, keeping macOS desktop profile auth isolated from the shared Keychain.

## [0.1.23] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- Superseded npm release; use `0.1.24` for the Codex App profile config fix.

## [0.1.22] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Profile creation and updates now prevent duplicate config directory ownership
  across profiles.

## [0.1.21] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Profile ownership metadata: `displayName`, `identity`, `cardLast4`, and
  JSON-safe `metadata` fields, with CLI support via `accounts add` and
  `accounts set`.

### Fixed

- Profile metadata updates now reject empty identity/name fields, reserved
  prototype keys, and non-finite numbers before writing the registry.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Hardened safe write-path symlink handling for account store writes.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Hardened account store file permissions.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Hardened profile purge path boundary checks.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Disambiguated active profile lookup by tool.

## [0.1.16] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Built-in `codex-app` tool for macOS Codex.app profile switching. It isolates
  both `CODEX_HOME` and Electron `--user-data-dir` per profile.
- Tool `launchArgs` templates for app-level launch arguments, including
  `{profileDir}`, `{profileName}`, and `{toolId}`.

### Fixed

- New Codex App profiles default to file-based Codex credential caching so
  ChatGPT auth stays inside the selected profile directory.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- `accounts login <name>` now infers the tool from an existing unambiguous profile instead of defaulting to Claude before lookup. `--tool` is only needed when creating a missing non-Claude profile or disambiguating duplicate names.
- README and CLI hints now prefer bare profile commands for unambiguous profiles.


## [0.1.14] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- `--permissions <preset>` for launch, switch, supervised switch, run, and MCP profile switching so tool-specific permission modes can be requested without hand-writing flags.
- Built-in dangerous permission mappings for Claude, Takumi, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, and Kimi, plus custom tool `--permission-arg preset=flag` support.

### Fixed

- macOS keychain write failures now report sanitized stderr/status instead of command arguments.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- Claude OAuth profiles now strip `apiKeyHelper` and API auth env settings before login, env, launch, supervisor restart, and apply so subscription profiles do not fall back to API-key auth.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Maintenance publish; no user-facing change note was recorded for this release.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `accounts run <tool>` supervisor mode. It starts Claude/Codex/opencode/etc. under `accounts` so a profile switch can restart the child process.
- Supervisor control commands: `accounts supervisor status`, `accounts supervisor switch`, and `accounts supervisor stop`.
- `accounts switch <profile> --supervisor` to ask a running supervisor to switch/restart the tool from another terminal.
- MCP `switch_profile` now talks to a running supervisor first; if found, it queues a real close/restart instead of only returning a handoff command.
- MCP `supervisor_status` tool.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `accounts switch <name> --tool <tool>` to switch profiles and print or launch a restart/resume command.
- `accounts-mcp` stdio server with `list_tools`, `list_profiles`, `current_profile`, and `switch_profile`.
- Resume handoff defaults for Claude (`claude --continue`), Codex (`codex resume --last`), and opencode (`opencode --continue`).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- `accounts login <name> --tool claude` now finalizes the login automatically after Claude exits:
  snapshots profile auth, refreshes detected email, and applies the profile to live/default Claude.

### Added

- Built-in profile adapters for opencode, Cursor Agent, Kimi Code, and Grok Build.
- Multi-env profile rendering (`extraEnv`) for tools that need more than one environment variable.
- Per-tool profile names: the same profile name can exist for different tools; ambiguous commands require `--tool`.

### Fixed

- Docs/UX aligned with CLI: three-pointer model (`current` / `applied` / isolated), hook guide,
  `pick` flags, `doctor` stale `current` check, `show` active/applied lines, dual list markers.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Apply lock creates `ACCOUNTS_HOME` before opening `.apply.lock` (fixes ENOENT on fresh installs).
- `pick --no-act` no longer applies (Commander `act: false` mapping).
- `loadStore` prunes stale `current` pointers; doctor reports stale `current`.
- `saveStore` / live writes scoped under `accountsHome()` / live base for macOS `/var` symlink safety.

### Added

- `src/security.test.ts` (11 tests), `docs/IMPLEMENT.md`, `docs/hook.md`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- Apply refuses profiles without auth (no longer deletes live OAuth).
- Import snapshots auth from the profile dir, not live disk.
- `rename` / `remove` maintain `store.applied` pointers.
- macOS keychain restore allowlists `Claude Code-credentials` only.
- Symlink guard on auth snapshot writes; profile names re-validated on store load.
- Apply uses an exclusive lock file; hook validates profile names and surfaces apply errors.
- `doctor` exits 1 on problems; checks stale `applied` pointers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Apply mode** (`accounts apply`) — sync profile auth to live Claude paths for Cursor/VS Code.
- Auth snapshots under `<profile>/.accounts-auth/` (OAuth, file credentials, macOS keychain).
- `accounts import`, `accounts login`, `accounts pick` (interactive).
- `accounts active` / `accounts applied` for scripting.
- `accounts hook install` — optional `claude()` shell wrapper.
- Store field `applied` per tool (separate from `current` for env/launch).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Initial release — a local-first CLI for managing multiple Claude Code (and other
  AI coding tool) profiles/accounts.
- Profiles with isolated config dirs and a remembered account email per profile.
- Email auto-detection from a tool's account file (Claude Code: `.claude.json` →
  `oauthAccount.emailAddress`).
- Commands: `add`, `list`/`ls`, `show`, `use`, `env`, `launch`/`run`, `shell`,
  `current`, `set`, `detect`, `rename`, `remove`/`rm`, `path`, `doctor`.
- Built-in tools: Claude Code (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) and Codex CLI (`CODEX_HOME`).
- Runtime tool registration (`accounts tools add/remove`) so the CLI scales to any
  app that reads a config dir from an environment variable — no code change required.
