# Native subscription authority

`@hasna/accounts/native-subscription` is the package-owned authority boundary
used by Infinity and AuthCapsule for native-subscription capacity. It is
additive to the profile-switching API: consumers must import the explicit
subpath, and the existing `@hasna/accounts` root contract remains unchanged.

The boundary carries metadata, signed receipts, generations, and digests only.
It never accepts, returns, persists, or transports credential payloads.

## Contracts

- `evaluateNativeSubscriptionProbe` verifies the authenticated owner together
  with the provider account, subscription, lane, AuthCapsule, canonical node,
  node key thumbprint, and every relevant generation before reporting
  capability or maintenance eligibility.
- `CapsuleMaintenanceAuthority` issues owner- and node-bound, short-lived
  maintenance grants only after it verifies Infinity's signed `HELD` receipt,
  drain evidence, transport identity, current state, and action-specific
  approval fields. Grants and consume receipts are ordinal-one.
- `consumeOnlineGenerationCheckReceiptUse` verifies the closed online
  generation receipt and delegates the one-use CAS to an Accounts-owned
  `OnlineGenerationReceiptUseStore`.
- `PostgresNativeCapabilityUseStore` implements that CAS with SERIALIZABLE
  transactions, deterministic advisory locks, forced row-level security,
  immutable receipt bytes, exact replay, and an owner-scoped unique
  capability tombstone.
- `PostgresCapsuleMaintenanceLedger` durably serializes maintenance grant
  reservation and consumption and returns stored evidence bytes on replay.

The in-memory stores are conformance adapters only. They are not durable
production substitutes.

## Postgres

`runPostgresMigrations` applies the dedicated, checksummed Accounts capacity
schema through version 4. It must run with a dedicated, non-elevated migration
owner connection after an operator provisions the `accounts` schema and runtime
roles. Runtime identity is configuration, never migration SQL: pass either a
dedicated direct `LOGIN` role or a configured `LOGIN` role that is the sole
non-admin member of a dedicated `NOLOGIN` role.

This migration set is separate from the existing `accounts-serve` profile
registry migrations. A self-hosted Infinity deployment should provision the
capacity schema explicitly. Use the same authoritative runtime-role setting
that feeds `HASNA_ACCOUNTS_RUNTIME_ROLE`; do not duplicate the role name in
application source. A direct boundary connects as that DML-only role. A
`set-role` boundary additionally requires a configured login-role name and
executes a transaction-local `SET ROLE`.

```ts
const runtimeRole = {
  mode: "set-role",
  roleName: configuredRuntimeRole,
  loginRoleName: configuredRuntimeLoginRole,
} as const;

await runPostgresMigrations(accountsCapacityMigrationSql, { runtimeRole });
```

The migrator reapplies the exact package-owned ACL and then catalog-attests the
runtime/login role attributes and membership, schema and object ownership,
public and runtime grants, RLS plus `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, every policy,
function security/search-path/execute contract, and every trigger. It also
compares the live PostgreSQL 17 catalog to the canonical package manifest for
every ordered column definition, PK/UNIQUE/CHECK/FK constraint, and
package-owned index definition including ordered keys and partial predicates.
A matching checksum ledger is necessary but not sufficient; drift fails closed
with `SCHEMA_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`.

Version 4 upgrades the migration ledger from timestamp-derived ordering to an
append-only, database-assigned `ledger_sequence`. Before that upgrade, a legacy
ledger is accepted only when every `applied_at` value is finite and unique and
the resulting order is the exact migration prefix. Equal timestamps are
ambiguous and fail closed before package SQL executes. Once upgraded, sequence
order is authoritative and timestamp ties no longer affect replay.

```ts
import {
  PostgresNativeCapabilityUseStore,
  consumeOnlineGenerationCheckReceiptUse,
} from "@hasna/accounts/native-subscription";

const useStore = new PostgresNativeCapabilityUseStore({
  client: accountsCapacitySql,
  principalRef: authenticatedInfinityPrincipal,
  runtimeRole,
  issuer: configuredIssuer,
  issuerIncarnation: configuredIssuerIncarnation,
  keyId: configuredSigningKeyId,
  audience: configuredInfinityAudience,
  privateKey: runtimeSigningKey,
  validateCurrent: async (request, transaction) => {
    // Read the coherent current deny/generation/frontier tuple using this same
    // transaction. Never return cached eligibility.
    return readCurrentCapabilityState(transaction, request);
  },
});

await consumeOnlineGenerationCheckReceiptUse(receiptBytes, expectation, guard, useStore);
```

Signing material is runtime configuration. Do not place it in source, task
evidence, logs, checkpoints, or stored receipt records.

## Downgrade and role changes

- Take and verify a database backup before first apply. The migration
  transaction rolls back package SQL when role or catalog attestation fails.
- Do not run an older migrator after a newer version has recorded a migration
  it does not know. Keep this migrator in place during an application rollback;
  older migration bytes fail checksum or newer-version checks by design.
- Schema migrations are forward-fix only. Do not delete ledger rows, disable
  forced RLS, drop immutable triggers, or rewrite recorded checksums to make an
  older binary start.
- Changing the configured runtime role or boundary mode is a maintenance
  operation. Stop runtime traffic, use the migration owner to revoke the old
  role's package-object grants, provision and validate the new role/membership,
  then rerun this migrator. Catalog attestation rejects leftover grants to an
  earlier runtime role.
