# Changelog

All notable changes to `@hasna/machines` are documented here. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `machines manifest` subcommands (`init`, `path`, `list`, `validate`,
  `bootstrap`, `get`, `remove`, `add`) now accept the standard `-j/--json`
  flag instead of hard-failing with `error: unknown option '--json'`, so
  uniform `--json` tooling no longer breaks on the manifest command group.

## [0.0.63] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Added `machines heartbeat collector-command` to emit the package-owned
  OpenLoops heartbeat collector command instead of relying on ad hoc scheduled
  shell snippets.
- Added `machines heartbeat collect --fail-on-error` so scheduled collector
  runs fail when any selected heartbeat import fails.

### Changed

- Documented that one-minute OpenLoops heartbeat collectors must use explicit
  low-latency targets and must not schedule `machines topology --all --json`,
  which only reads stale topology rows.

### Added

- Root open-source release policy files: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Changed

- Release verification now uses Bun package-manager commands instead of
  requiring `npm` on PATH.

## [0.0.58] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Added loop-ready `machines ops db-integrity` and
  `machines ops state-snapshot` commands for bounded SQLite integrity checks,
  verified ops-state snapshots, private JSON evidence, and deduped todos task
  upserts.
- Added regression coverage for WAL-mode snapshot safety, sqlite3 missing
  fail-closed behavior, bounded truncation output, private report/snapshot
  permissions, retention safety, and task-upsert idempotency.

### Fixed

- Collapsed missing sqlite3 into one dependency-level task suggestion, capped
  default machine-data task creation, and fixed snapshot paths containing
  apostrophes.

## [0.0.55] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- `machines ops check` can now opt into safe deduped todos task creation with
  `--upsert-tasks --todos-project <path>` while preserving the default
  read-only diagnostics behavior.
- Added SDK exports for argv-safe Fleet Ops task upserts so deterministic loops
  can route machine/topology/tmux findings through tasks instead of tmux panes.
